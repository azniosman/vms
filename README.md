A **secure, enterprise-grade** Visitor Management System (VMS) built with C++ and Qt, featuring comprehensive security measures and full compliance with Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and GDPR requirements.

## üîí Security First

This VMS implementation prioritizes security and privacy protection with:

- ‚úÖ **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities** - Comprehensive security audit completed
- üîê **Enterprise Authentication** - PBKDF2 password hashing, account lockout protection
- üóÑÔ∏è **Encrypted Database** - AES-256 encryption with secure key management
- üõ°Ô∏è **Input Validation** - SQL injection and XSS prevention on all inputs
- üìä **Audit Logging** - Complete audit trails for compliance
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Secure Configuration** - Encrypted settings and integrity validation

## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- **C++17** or later (modern C++ features)
- **Qt 6.x** (Core, Widgets, SQL, Network, PrintSupport)
- **OpenSSL** (cryptographic operations)
- **SQLite 3.x** with encryption support
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+

### Build Dependencies
- **CMake 3.16** or later
- **Qt 6 development tools** (qmake, moc, uic, rcc)
- **OpenSSL development libraries**
- **Modern C++ compiler** with C++17 support (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2019+)
- **Git** for version control

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake qtbase6-dev libqt6widgets6-dev \
                     libqt6sql6-sqlite libqt6network6-dev libssl-dev git

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install qt6 cmake openssl git

# Windows (with vcpkg)
vcpkg install qt6[core,widgets,sql,network] openssl
```

### 2. Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/azniosman/vms.git
cd vms

# Quick build using the provided script
./build.sh

# Or manual build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)  # Linux/macOS
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
# From project root
./build/vms

# First run will create default admin user
# Username: admin, Password: TempAdmin123!@#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THIS PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY!
```

## Configuration

### Database Setup
The system uses SQLite with encryption for data storage. The database file is automatically created at:
- Linux: `~/.local/share/VMS/vms.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/VMS/vms.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\VMS\vms.db`

### Security Configuration
1. Set up IP whitelist in the settings
2. Configure password policies
3. Set up data retention periods
4. Configure SSL/TLS certificates

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **Change default admin password** immediately after first login
- [ ] **Configure IP whitelist** to restrict access to authorized networks
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS** with valid SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] **Set up log monitoring** and security alerting
- [ ] **Configure firewall rules** to limit network exposure
- [ ] **Enable database backups** with encryption
- [ ] **Review user permissions** and implement least privilege
- [ ] **Set up vulnerability scanning** and security monitoring

### Ongoing Security Maintenance
1. **Monitor audit logs** regularly for suspicious activity
2. **Update dependencies** and apply security patches promptly
3. **Review user access** and remove inactive accounts
4. **Test backup/restore** procedures regularly
5. **Conduct security assessments** periodically
6. **Train staff** on security procedures and threat awareness
