- Encrypted storage of biometric data (photos, ID scans, signatures)
- Granular consent management with withdrawal capabilities
- Automatic data retention and purging policies
- Data access logging for audit trails
- Data portability features
- Right to be forgotten implementation

**Data Security:**

- Secure file handling with path validation
- Data minimization principles

### 5. Security Logging & Monitoring ✅ COMPLETED

**Comprehensive Audit Logging:**
- Security event logging (authentication, authorization, data access)
- Failed authentication tracking
- Privilege escalation attempt detection
- Data access audit trails
- Configurable log levels and destinations

**Monitoring Features:**
- Rate limiting with automatic blocking
- Anomaly detection capabilities

- Audit logging configuration

### 7. Modern UI Security ✅ COMPLETED

**Secure User Interface:**
- Modern login dialog with security features:
  - Inactivity timeout (5 minutes)
  - Progressive lockout display
  - Secure password handling
  - Session management integration
- Dashboard with role-based access control
- Input validation on all forms
- XSS protection in UI components

### 8. Network & Communication Security

**Security Headers & Protocols:**
- HTTPS enforcement ready
- Secure cookie settings
- CSRF protection framework
- Content security policy ready
- Security headers implementation

## Dependency Security Review

### Core Dependencies Analysis
